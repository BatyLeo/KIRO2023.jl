This repository contains a Julia starting code for the 2023 edition of the KIRO.

Instances are in the `instances` [folder](https://github.com/BatyLeo/KIRO2023.jl/tree/main/instances).

## Installation

You need to have julia v1.9 or higher already installed to use this package.

To install, run the following code in a Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/BatyLeo/KIRO2023.jl")

julia> using KIRO2023
```

Some utility functions are available for getting started easily with the challenge.

**Note**: alternatively, you can also just download the Julia source code of this repository and use it/modify it for your needs in your code without using the `KIRO2023` package.
